Pseudocode
RetirementCalculator
Start
1. Define variables for the nouns in the statement
- What is your age? = currentAge
- At what age would you like to retire? = retirementAge
- You have 40 years left until you can retire = yearsLeft
- Calculate yearsLeft by getting the difference between retirementAge and currentAge
    yearsLeft = retirementAge - currentAge
2. Prompt the user to enter currentAge saying "What is your current age?"
3. Prompt the user to enter retirementAge saying "At what age would you like to retire?"
4. Get the current year in JavaScript by defining it as var d = new Date() 
5. Define the current year variable by assigning currentYear = d.getFullYear()
6. Determine the retirement year by assigning its variable as retirementYear and 
   calculate it by getting the sum of currentYear and yearsLeft
    var retirementYear = currentYear + yearsLeft
7. After variable assignments and calculations, the program should display the following
    "You have (yearsLeft) years left until you can retire."
    "It's (currentYear), so you can retire in (retirementYear)."
